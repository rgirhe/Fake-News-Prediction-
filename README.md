# Fake-News-Prediction-

**1.In this project we are going to see how we can build a machine learning system that can predict whether a news is fake or real using logistic regression machine learning model.**

**2.let's understand the workflow we are going to follow first is the collection of data so we need to collect this news data**

**3.The data set we are going to use is basically a label data set so it consists of several thousand of news articles and it will be labeled as either it is real news or fake news.**

**4.It also contains other details such as the author of that particular news the title of the news etc okay so once we have this data set we need to pre-process this datawe train our machine learning model so we need to evaluate our model so that can be done using the test data**

**5.In this project we are going to use a logistic regression model because this is a binary classification means we are going to classify the result into two types it's either real or fake.**

**6.So once we train this logistic regression model we get a trained model so we will do some evaluations on this model. we find the accuracy score of this model using the test data now once that done we have a trained logistic regression model**

**7.In this trained regression model so we feed new data to this model so for those which we don't know whether the news is real or fake. once we give the data to our model it can predict whether the news is real or fake**

**8. Open a VS Code or Pycham whichever is convient for you.**

**9. streamlit run Type fake_news_prediction_new.py**

**10.It will open a streamlit web interface which is free hosting of data science projects**
